        <h2 id="what_is_la_cocina">What is La Cocina?</h2>
        <p><a href="http://www.lacocinasf.org/">La Cocina</a> is a non-profit incubator kitchen that provides affordable commercial kitchen space and industry-specific technical assistance to low-income and immigrant entrepreneurs who are launching, growing and formalizing food businesses.</p>

        <h2 id="why_do_we_host">Why do we host this festival?</h2>
        <img class="mood_img" src="images/why_we_host.jpg" alt="Why Mission" />
        <p>La Cocina was born out of the entrepreneurial spirit of women vendors in San Francisco&rsquo;s Mission District who launched businesses out of their homes, on the streets and wherever they could find the spaces to do it. Beginning in 2005, La Cocina advocated for progressive city policies that would allow these incredibly talented chefs to formally bring their products to the marketplace. This festival is a celebration of the taste, the heart and the commitment of our <a href="http://www.lacocinasf.org/directory/">vendors</a>, the small business owners in San Francisco who have supported a community of eaters that believe in this kind of food and the food trucks, carts, trailers and informal entrepreneurs that continue to make this city the best food city in the world. </p>

        <h2 id="why_is_your_festival">Why Is Your Festival in The Mission?</h2>
        <img class="mood_img" src="images/why_mission.jpg" alt="Why Mission" />
        <p>The Mission is our home. Our entrepreneurs come from here, our hearts beat for here and we really and truly believe that street food should be eaten on the street. If we could, we&rsquo;d get rid of all the white tents, and just do it block party style, but that&rsquo;s not so cool with the health department, so you will have to imagine it with us. </p>
        <p>Also, and worth noting, is that we believe that this is the best neighborhood in the world. The <a href="http://www.lower24thstreet.org/english/index.html">merchants</a>, the neighbors and the community as a whole are part and parcel of who we are. And we wouldn&rsquo;t be here without them. At its soul, this festival is not only a celebration of food and entrepreneurship, but also of this neighborhood. Support our neighborhood businesses!</p>

        <h2 id="what_do_you_do_with">What Do You Do With All That $$$?</h2>
        <p>We began this festival as a celebration of vendors and entrepreneurship, and that has always been our focus. As a result, this event, while something of a fundraiser for La Cocina, generates far more revenue for the vendors than it ever will for us as an organization. We keep the entry costs at break-even and work to provide as much support to vendors to ensure the opportunity for them to create the capital they need to grow. In the meantime, your donations, support and passport purchases all benefit La Cocina to some extent. For more information on donations, <a href="http://www.lacocinasf.org">click here</a>.</p>

        <h2 id="why_so_many_restaurants">Why Are There So Many Restaurants? And Why Are They From Outside the Neighborhood?</h2>
        <img class="mood_img" src="images/why_so_many.jpg" alt="Why So Many" />
        <p>Firstly, well, 80,000 people is a lot of people to feed! But, more importantly, because street food is a global phenomenon that produces some of the most amazing food you can put your mouth to. In order to speak to the quality and diversity of global street food, we hand-select some of the best and the brightest vendors in the city of San Francisco, all from owner-operated establishments, to come to the streets for one day and play by our rules. No fancy restaurant kitchens, no high price tags&hellip; not even any electricity. </p>
        <p>We are going to have 80+ vendors, half of whom are part of La Cocina&rsquo;s incubator program. La Cocina works with low-income and immigrant entrepreneurs and is committed to creating this festival as an opportunity to show all of the city exactly how talented these entrepreneurs are and how delicious their food is. We fully believe that the tacos from Chaac Mool, Azalina&rsquo;s curry or down-home Mexican food from El Buen Comer are as good (and often better) than the foods made by this food-obsessed town&rsquo;s top chefs.</p>

        <h2 id="what_about_parking">What about parking?</h2>
        <p>Due to the festival and the street closures, there will be no street parking available. Please keep in mind that any driveways on the affected streets will also not be accessible.  We encourage you to take public transportation or ride your bike in order to avoid any unnecessary headaches. </p>

        <h2 id="how_much_is_it">How much is it to get in the festival?</h2>
        <p>
The event is free, but is a fundraiser for La Cocina, so donations are encouraged at the door for those that are able to give.</p> 
<p>
All festival proceeds benefit La Cocina&rsquo;s business incubator program. Food vendors will only be accepting cash or pre-purchased passport tickets.
        </p>

        <h2 id="interested_in_participating">I&rsquo;m a food vendor and interested in participating in the festival whom do I get in touch with?</h2>
        <p>La Cocina will hold our annual Vote your Vendor contest for food vendors interested in having a booth.  We invite the public to nominate their favorite food truck, trailer, cart, informal entrepreneur or home cook to participate in this year&#x27;s Festival. This could be you! The top 4 vote getters will receive a free space at the festival, free kitchen time and small business assistance. Winners will be announced on July 27th. Please <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/lacocinasf.org/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dHBQYm9tQzRVdFRpaG5yTlF0XzMtQmc6MQ">sign up here</a> to receive Vote your Vendor contest updates and alerts.</p>

        <h1>POLICY</h1>
        <p>When we began this festival in 2009, Street Food in San Francisco meant late night bacon wrapped hot dogs, pretzels at Golden Gate Park and possibly running into the Creme Brulee Guy&rsquo;s homemade cart on a walk through the Mission. In the four years that have followed, there has been a veritable Street Food boon in this city. Curtis now sells his creme brulee from a state of the art trailer, you can legally buy Yucatecan nachos from the Chaac Mool trailer in Dolores Park and Off the Grid Markets have set up shop at seemingly every park and plaza around. </p>
        <p>Within the last two years, the City of San Francisco, in an effort to acknowledge the rapidly evolving street food industry, has taken steps to facilitate the permitting process for MFFs (&ldquo;mobile food facilities&rdquo; like food trucks and trailers) by making the regulations more accessible and financially feasible. In March 2011, new legislation came into effect that transferred the authority to permit to the Department of Public Works and opened up a significant amount of public street space to use by street food businesses. While this legislation is progressive, and a testament to the passionate street food advocacy of constituents through the city, there continue to exist inherent obstacles within the permitting process. Entrepreneurs and organizations throughout San Francisco continue to work alongside the City to advocate for improved regulations. Currently, stakeholders are collaborating with Supervisor Scott Wiener to oppose statewide legislation that will increase the buffer around schools, eliminating a large portion of areas available for street food permitting.</p>
        <p>These complicated regulations make it particularly difficult for entrepreneurs who lack access to resources, or for whom English is a second language, to take advantage of the opportunities for formalization that are increasingly available. The result is that while street food has experienced a huge rise in popularity, there still exists an informal economy that is struggling to maintain its vibrancy and diversity while coping with city laws and ordinances that have (often) been established to favor the existing tax base of brick and mortar businesses.</p>
        <p>The simple fact is that while many people start mobile food carts because it is an inexpensive option for culinary entrepreneurs, the goal of transitioning to fully legal members of the San Francisco business community is full of burdensome financial costs and confusing regulations. For this reason we need to continue to take steps to ensure that regulations around and opportunities within mobile food are made equally accessible to and viable to entrepreneurs from all backgrounds and means. </p>
        <p>Revised regulations and policies that allow street food vendors greater flexibility in how, where, and when they can sell their goods to reach a broader consumer base can help to activate underutilized space, provide job opportunities to entrepreneurs at all levels of the economic spectrum and have the ability to provide the city with increased tax revenue and jobs at a time when it would be very valued. This will require an on-going collaboration between government, non-profit and community stakeholders, as well as a continued passion from you, the consumer to give talented entrepreneurs the opportunities to make a living doing what it is they love to&nbsp;do.</p>
