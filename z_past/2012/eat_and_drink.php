          <p>Heirloom Caf_ was founded with two concurrent ambitions: to offer a wide variety of aged wines from a carefully managed cellar, and to serve simple, very well-prepared food at reasonable prices. Our wine cellar and our love of mature wines are the foundation of our restaurant. We have been actively identifying and sourcing wines from our favorite producers in California and regions all over Europe for many years, and we are thrilled, every night at the restaurant, to be able to offer dozens of different wines which have had years in the bottle to improve. The kitchen at Heirloom is dedicated to offering a menu which is concise, seasonal, highly selective and exceedingly tasteful. We are not any more interested to work with harder-to-find, esoteric ingredients than we are to work with very good carrots and onions. Whatever time of year, we pride ourselves on developing plates and presentations which maximize flavor, aesthetic beauty and integrity, and value.</p>

Hailing from Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, Lali Ghlonti, founder of Lali’s, brings you tasty chicken blintzes, savory kidney bean spread, and Badridzani nigvzit – her favorite dish from home, sliced eggplant sautéed in a scrumptious walnut paste made with cilantro, coriander, balsamic, and fenugreek and topped with pomegranate seeds. Lali moved to San Francisco from Georgia in 2004 to attend the Food Technology & Dining Services, and Baking and Pastry programs at San Francisco City College and make her dream of becoming a chef a reality. “Cooking is an addiction in Georgia,” says Lali, “And everyone has it.” When she’s not scouring Bay Area grocery stores for pomegranate molasses – a thick pomegranate sauce often combined with lamb or used in other hearty Georgian dishes, you might find Lali enjoying time with her family or adding to her small elephant collection for good luck! Her Georgian, Middle Eastern, and Mediterranean food is so good though, we don't think she'll need any luck! </p>

Using a miniscule six-pound batch roaster, he makes an historic vow: I will only sell coffee less than 48 hours out of the roaster to my customers, so they may enjoy coffee at its peak of flavor. I will only use the finest organic, and pesticide-free, shade-grown beans. In honor of Kolschitskys heroics, he names his business The Blue Bottle Coffee Company, and begins another chapter in the history of superlative coffee.</p>

          <p>Veronica Salazar was born in the neighborhood of Ramon Millan in Mexico City, Mexico, where she grew up around food, both in her home and in the restaurant that her family owned. When Veron­ica moved to San Fran­cisco, she saw that there were many taquerias, but she felt they lacked the sazon (magic touch) of kitchens from back home. She took this as an opportunity to bring the authentic flavors of the D.F. to S.F. You can now find Veronica and her entire family doling out her beloved huaraches, mixiotes and cactus salad every Saturday at the Alemany and Marin Farmer’s Market, and at their brick-and-mortar restaurant at the Marin Country Mart in Larkspur Landing.</p>

          <p>Hapa San Francisco serves local, natural and sustainable Filipino cuisine. We source the finest ingredients, organic whenever possible, to create dishes inspired by California but firmly grounded in their Filipino roots. Our mission is to eradicate the perception that Filipino cuisine is unhealthy and establish its reputation as one of the finest Southeast Asian cuisines. I knew I would one day help garner Filipino cuisine the attention it deserved. I spent several years working in restaurants with some of the best chefs in San Francisco -- Ron Siegel, Laurent Gras, David Kinch, and Josef Centeno -- honing my craft while perfecting the dishes of my youth paired with the bounty of San Franciscos farmers markets. I opened Hapa S.F. in its present form on April 28th 2010 in probably one of the cheapest ever restaurant openings. We ended up getting reviewed to no knowledge of our own on our third day of service, the title of the article Filipino taco truck lives up to the hype. The rest is very quickly becoming history thanks to all of our fans.</p>

My love for street food started in Mumbai, one of the world's great street food cities. I have great memories of eating along Chowpatty Beach as a little girl -- pani puri, bheja masala fry, pav bhaji and of course Kwality Vanilla ice cream were my favorites! I'm inspired by street vendors because of the passion they put into making one dish and only one dish extremely well. We opened Kasa in the Castro over three years ago and now have full-fledged food truck so we can serve our street food on actual streets! Our Kati Rolls are traditional street food from Calcutta.</p>

          <p>On a warm summer Mexican day in 1940, after having sold his fair share of shoes, medicines and kitchen utensils and of course Pan Dulce, Gabriel Maldonado age 20, had a brief thought  The United States doesnt sound so bad and the Bracero Program, was still being offered. It was a hard choice to leave behind a tradition of over 100 years of baking for the hopeful fruits of the United States.Fortunate for us, (you and I alike) San Francisco was the final destination, and in 1951 Don Gabriel Maldonado opened a little bakery at 2951 24th Street named La Victoria Bakery. At the time it was mostly an Italian and Irish working class neighborhood in the inner mission near to St. Peters Church. He eyed the location across the street, home of Murphys Drug store, as a better location as it was directly next to the church and on the sunnier side  of the street. In 1955 he moved across the street and never looked back. Now, in the capable hands of Jaime Maldonado and Pastry Chef Luis Villavelazques, La Victoria continues to thrive.</p>

But there was another, much more pedestrian, reason that made the name OSHA Thai so appealing and it's easy to say. From a simple restaurant in the Tenderloin, the family of OSHA Thai restaurants have grown in popularity and sophistication, the first OSHA Thai debuted in 1996, and since then, six more have opened across the city.

          <p>Ritual Coffee Roasters opened in May 2005 with the intention to share amazing coffee with San Francisco and it was only a matter of weeks, or maybe just one, before Ritual had a line out the door. Many of our customers asked what we were doing to our coffee to make it taste so good, while the connoisseurs simply wanted to know what took us so long to get here. With a strict focus on direct sourcing and strengthening relationships with those producers, Ritual has continued to offer delicious coffees and a great experience to its customers, year after year.</p>

          <p>Charles Phan is the visionary and executive chef of the restaurant, but he has not done it alone. There are upwards of 18 Phan siblings, cousins, aunts, nephews working with Charles, plus some 70 employees, 75% of whom have been with the restaurant from the start 7 years ago. There are numerous bright stars in the Slanted Door family constellation. The Phans are ethnically Chinese, but were born and raised in Vietnam. Their father fled China during that country's tumultuous times and they were not inclined to stick around after the North Vietnamese took control. On April 30, 1975 they found themselves floating at sea, part of the Boat People exodus. Essentially lost and living on rations, they floated for 10 days, rescued by a Malaysian ship which brought them to Singapore. From Singapore harbor (they were never let ashore) they ended up in a refugee camp in Guam. A year and a half later they immigrated to San Francisco, where they took up residence in SF's Tenderloin district, a classic first stop for Asian immigrants. From there it was Chinatown.While in Chinatown, Charles began going to school at Mission High School in San Francisco's Mission district, where The Slanted Door would eventually open its doors.</p>

          <p>It’s said that when you’re born you come into the world knowing exactly what you’re supposed to do with your life. Due to numerous distractions, most of us take detours on our journeys spending quite a lot of time trying to discover our way back to that knowingness. At the young age of 8 years old, Chef Dionne Knox remembers spending most of her time in the kitchen with her grandmother, Zella, cooking meals and baking delicious desserts. Zella was a dynamic chef known for cooking everything from scratch. To ensure the best flavors in her cooking, Zella grew fresh vegetables in her garden, raised chickens for fresh eggs, made her own jam, baked bread every day and churned her own butter. At Zella's Soulful Kitchen we continue this tradition by providing farm-fresh handcrafted soulfood.</p>

Their goal was that their frank would become a way to nourish both eaters and growers. Let's be Frank supports the ever-shrinking group of family farmers and ranchers committed to raising their animals in a humane, conscientious, and healthy manner and in so creates dogs gone good.</p>

When Dilsa came to the Bay Area it was very exciting for her to discover the organic food movement. She realized that there weren’t many Mexican restaurants that that offered healthy alternatives for people and the environment. This is what inspired her to start a Mexican food business using local, organic, and seasonal ingredients whenever possible. 

Los Cilantros is a catering and events company whose mission is never to lose authenticity, and to carefully prepare food with simple flavors using the best ingredients available. You can also feast on Dilsa's food at Copita in Sausalito where she is the sous chef. </p>

Her wide repertoire includes classics such as chocolate dipped almond toffee with sea salt, and explores novel savory varieties like prosciutto parmesan, sweet potato maple bacon, and honey lemon thyme. “I like to think there’s always a taste to a place,” says Olive, whose twists on her grandmother’s recipes incorporate Southern tastes from her own childhood growing up in Alabama, Virginia, and Texas, as well as the inspiration she draws from the bounty and diversity of California. Olive plans to build on her extensive professional background in social work to develop a skills-training and workforce development program at Saint & Olive that employs women rejoining the workforce. “I feel like this is a way to develop and nurture communities, to build a business that is sustainable and contributes to the people and the environment while offering creative and heart-warming foods.” When she’s not devising tasty new recipes, you might find her plucking her banjo with friends or knitting up a storm to keep her warm in San Francisco!</p>

          <p>When Morsinah Katimin started Sajen she wanted to share jamu, an Indonesian drink known for easing physical aches and pains and achieving overall wellness. Making jamu has been a long-time tradition in Morsina's family. At Sajen we use our ancestral grandmothers' formula, and we make jamu with fresh-cut, sustainable, unprocessed, organic ingredients whenever possible. Sajen has expanded its product line with sambal, a chili-based condiment used to add a dark, fiery flavor to dishes. Our products can be found at Whole Foods and the La Cocina kiosk in the Ferry Building</p>

          <p>Taino’s Puerto Rican Food was a 40th birthday present from Owner Lisa Callaghan to herself. Armed with a passion to cook and desire to share the hidden treasure of Puerto Rican food with Northern California, Lisa first brought Taino’s to the masses with help from the Women’s Initiative at La Cocina’s 2011 Street Food Festival. Building upon her Puerto Rican Grandma’s traditional recipes, she served up almost 1,000 pastelillos (empanadas) to a hungry crowd.  This year, Lisa was accepted into La Cocina’s kitchen incubator program, where she’s looking forward to not only joining the festival again but growing her catering and food truck business.</p>

          <p>Inspired by her late grandmother , Yvonne has been living out a family legacy of serving mouth-watering homemade southern sweets since 2003. A San Francisco native, Yvonne began at home sharing her special recipe of pralines, a confection pecan candy originating from the Old South. Perfecting a recipe given by a close family friend, Yvonne began sharing her creations with family, friends and co-workers. Everyone who sampled her pralines would rant and rave of the delicious authentic flavor and encouraged Yvonne to share her tasty treats with others. Using her enterprising talents, Yvonne began making her pralines and expanded her offerings to include other specialty desserts such as ol school butter cookies, sweet potato pies, peach cobblers, and cakes for small parties and social gatherings at the request of family, friends and local community organizations. The small order requests quickly grew into large orders of 100-200 guests at local civic and social events. Yvonne opened her store in the Bayview Hunters Point community in 2006& and the rest is history.</p>
