          <p>A16 shares a name with the highway that runs from Naples to Canosa, Puglia. True to its namesake, it gathers inspiration from southern Italy, particulary Campania, the region surrounding Naples. Chef Chris Thompson oversees the menu, which features fresh pasta, house-butchered and house-cured meats and authentic Neopolitan pizza. Complementing the rustic menu, wine director/owner Shelley Lindgren selects wines that highlight the indigenous grapes from Campania and nearby regions. Since A16 opened in February 2004, it&rsquo; had the honor of welcoming several renowned, Italian winemakers for wine dinners and special events. It also celebrates local farmers and purveyors by partnering with organizations such as Outstanding in the Field, Roots of Change, and Slow Food.</p>

          <h1><a href="http://www.gfcateringsf.com/">Good Foods Catering</a></h1>
          <p>The idea behind Good Foods Catering was sparked by the owner Dontaye Ball, who was born and raised in San Francisco. Dontaye Ball grew up in a family where all of his relatives loved to cook. He was inspired by his grandmother, who always cooked from her soul. She only used the best ingredients even if that meant going to her backyard to use food that she grew with her own hands. When Dontaye set out to pursue a culinary lifestyle, he would only work for places that exhibited the values that were instilled from his grandmother. His culinary career started at the City College of San Francisco Culinary Arts Program, and since then he has worked at some of the best restaurants, such as Delfina, Delfina Pizzeria, Google, and Contigo. Dontaye took this foundation with him when he created Good Food Catering.  Good Foods only uses the best ingredients. All of the products are made using natural ingredients from local farmers. Good Foods uses meat that has no antibiotics or hormones from birth to box. The idea is to take BBQ to the next level using interesting ingredients like hog jowls, pork belly and beef cheeks. Chef Dontaye has so much passion for making Good Food even if that means he has to make own bacon for his famous bacon BBQ sauce. He likes to make food that bring people together and want people to be able to enjoy something different. He wants to make sure everyone the he comes in contact with has a chance to enjoy Good Food.</p>

          <p>On a warm summer Mexican day in 1940, after having sold his fair share of shoes, medicines, kitchen utensils, and pan dulce, Gabriel Maldonado (age 20) had a brief thought. The United States doesn&rsquo;t sound so bad, and the Bracero Program was still being offered. It was a hard choice to leave behind a tradition of over 100 years of baking for the hopeful fruits of the United States. Fortunately for him, San Francisco was his final destination, and in 1951, Don Gabriel Maldonado opened a little bakery at 2951 24th Street named La Victoria Bakery. At the time it was mostly an Italian and Irish working-class neighborhood in the Inner Mission near St. Peter&rsquo;s Church. He eyed the location across the street, home of Murphy&rsquo;s Drug Store, as a better location as it was directly next to the church and on the sunnier side  of the street. In 1955, he moved across the street and never looked back. Now, in the capable hands of Jaime Maldonado and pastry chef Luis Villavelazques, La Victoria continues to thrive.</p>

There is nothing more gratifying to Pinky than to see the happy faces of people enjoying her tasty creations. A friend pressured her to participate in the 2011 San Francisco Street Food Festival, and the rest is history. Her dream was to open a breakfast spot with many items, such as sweet potato pie waffles, peach cobbler waffles, red velvet pancakes, maple glazed bacon, and strawberry shortcake French toast. Life is short&hellip;eat something memorable.</p>

          <p>Radio Africa &amp; Kitchen was created by Chef Eskender Aseged. Originally from Ethiopia, Eskender arrived in San Francisco in the late 80s where he spent the next 20 years working in the Bay Area with such luminaire chefs as Jeremiah Tower, Joyce Goldstein, Nancy Oaks, Daniel Peterson, and Daniel Humm. During this time, inspired by these great chefs, he began experimenting with different food preparations of his own.</p>

          <p>When you dine with Radio Africa &amp; Kitchen, you will enjoy a seasonal, nutritionally well-balanced meal that always includes organic vegetables, greens, grains, nuts, wild fish, shellfish and fruit, accompanied by fine herbs and spices.</p>

          <p>Rice Paper Scissors was created by Valerie Luu and Katie Kwan, two Vietnamese street food vendors in San Francisco who love sitting on small stools. Inspired by the sidewalk dining and street food they experienced in Vietnam, they wanted to recreate the experience in the Mission&mdash;complete with small tables, even smaller stools, fresh Vietnamese condiments, Cambodian pop music, and a rotating menu of Vietnamese comfort foods.</p>

Rosa, hailing from Mexico, once had paintings exhibited in galleries before she learned the art of creating paintings in this palatable medium. Gelatin art can be traced to France, before being imported to Mexico where it was developed and perfected, but Rosa is proud to now bring these sweet creations to San Francisco. Her work is available by special order on her website.</p>

Building upon her Puerto Rican grandma&rsquo;s traditional recipes, she served up almost 1,000 pastelillos (empanadas) to a hungry crowd.</p>

          <p>Inspired by her late grandmother, Yvonne has been living out a family legacy of serving mouth-watering homemade southern sweets since 2003. A San Francisco native, Yvonne began at home sharing her special recipe of pralines, a confection pecan candy originating from the Old South. Perfecting a recipe given by a close family friend, Yvonne began sharing her creations with family, friends and co-workers. Everyone who sampled her pralines would rant and rave of the delicious authentic flavor and encouraged Yvonne to share her tasty treats with others. Using her enterprising talents, Yvonne began making her pralines and expanded her offerings to include other specialty desserts such as ol school butter cookies, sweet potato pies, peach cobblers, and cakes for small parties and social gatherings at the request of family, friends and local community organizations. The small order requests quickly grew into large orders of 100-200 guests at local civic and social events. Yvonne opened her store in the Bayview Hunters Point community in 2006, and the rest is history.</p>

          <p>It&rsquo;s said that when you&rsquo;re born, you come into the world knowing exactly what you&rsquo;re supposed to do with your life. Due to numerous distractions, most of us take detours on our journeys, spending quite a lot of time trying to discover our way back to that knowingness. At the young age of eight years old, Chef Dionne Knox remembers spending most of her time in the kitchen with her grandmother, Zella, cooking meals and baking delicious desserts. Zella was a dynamic chef known for cooking everything from scratch. To ensure the best flavors in her cooking, Zella grew fresh vegetables in her garden, raised chickens for fresh eggs, made her own jam, baked bread every day, and churned her own butter. At Zella&rsquo;s Soulful Kitchen, she continues this tradition by providing farm-fresh, handcrafted soul food.</p>
