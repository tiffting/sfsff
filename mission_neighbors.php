      <h1>Mission Neighbors</h1>
      <p>First and foremost, we hope our Mission neighbors take as much pride in the festival as we do. Amidst parking limitations, we hope our Mission neighbors recognize that the street beyond their front porch is more than just a space for serving delicious food but a platform for supporting food entrepreneurs, many of whom hail from <a href="http://lacocinasf.org/">La Cocina&rsquo;s kitchen</a> and the neighborhood. In the last couple of years, in collaboration with the <a href="http://www.lower24thstreet.org/english/index.html">Lower 24th St. Merchant&rsquo;s Association</a>, we&rsquo;ve been thrilled to see an increase in representation from the commercial corridor in this neighborhood.</p>
      <p>Of course, we always want to hear your thoughts on the festival and we&rsquo;re happy to work with you and help however we can. For any and all questions or just to find out more about <a href="http://www.lacocinasf.org/">La Cocina</a>, <a href="mailto:proevent@lacocinasf.org">email Cindy</a> or call <a href="tel:+14157014683">(415) 701-4683</a> for more info.</p>
